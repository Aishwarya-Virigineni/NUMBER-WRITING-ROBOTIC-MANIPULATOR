# NUMBER-WRITING-ROBOTIC-MANIPULATOR
In this problem we can see the working of a number writing planar robotic manipulator in MATLAB with graphical interface. We can build the number writing manipulator using any degree of freedom. Inverse kinematics is used by the manipulator to draw the number. When the user runs the code, he will be shown the list of numbers the manipulator can draw. The list of numbers includes (1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 0). So, when the user chooses a particular number among the list, the robotic manipulator will draw that number in a graphical plot.
